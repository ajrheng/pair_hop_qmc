# Quantum Monte Carlo - Pair Hopping Bose-Hubbard Model

A Fortran 90 implementation of the Stochastic Series Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, used to study a pair hopping Bose-Hubbard model on a 2D square lattice. Paper using code published in [PRB 2019](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.100.104433).

Requires either `gfortran` or intel's `ifort` (standard on high performance clusters) to compile.
